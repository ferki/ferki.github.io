            <h1 id="rexopsfamily">RexOps family</h1>

<p>I am contributing to the <a href="https://github.com/RexOps">RexOps</a> family of projects since 2013. As lead maintainer of <a href="https://www.rexify.org">Rex, the friendly automation framework</a>, I am providing a wide range of related services, including consultation, training, and development.</p>

<h1 id="modernperl">Modern Perl</h1>

<p>While I find the history and ecosystem of Perl fascinating, I consider myself fortunate enough to gain all my experience already in the modern Perl era.</p>

<p>Whether you are planning to kick off a new project, or tackling challenges of legacy code bases, I&#39;d be happy to lend a hand around development, quality assurance, and test automation.</p>

<h1 id="devops">DevOps</h1>

<h2 id="itinfrastructureingeneral">IT infrastructure in general</h2>

<p>Designing, building, and maintaining IT infrastructure have been among my responsibilities throughout my entire career. I have helped my teams to deliver solutions up to the scale of few hundred managed endpoints in both bare metal and cloud environments. These projects often enabled cost optimization, or opened new revenue streams.</p>

<p>I am passionate about lightweight, simple solutions (KISS), and love to optimize for high performance. I can set up or optimize infrastructure as code (IaC), automate processes, introduce test-driven infrastructure operations, and enable insights into the systems through monitoring, metric collection, and log analytics.</p>

<h2 id="versioncontrolsystems">Version control systems</h2>

<p>Introducing or improving version control strategy is often a straightforward way to improve development processes. Git enjoys quite widespread adoption nowadays, but merely using it does not automatically mean everything else around it is also getting better.</p>

<p>I can set up version control systems based on Git, train colleagues about usage patterns, and design a development workflow fitting the team and environment.</p>
